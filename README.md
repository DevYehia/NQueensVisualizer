# NQueensVisualizer
This Project aims to visualize the N-Queens Problem using C++ and Qt
In the src folder, you can find the source code and images used
In the app folder, you can find the built application so you can run it without having to build the code

# The Problem
Provided and n x n board. We need to try to place n queens on this board such that no 2 queens attack each other. This program generates all possible solutions for this problem (if any)

# Algorithm Used
Here, We use a backtracking algorithm to try every possible configuration of queens until we find a solution or find that there is no solution
